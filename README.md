# Colour Mine

A simple mining game - in progress.

**Features done**:
- clicking on any square causes patch of same-coloured squares to disappear
- surrounding squares of patch change colour according to a set pattern
- clicking any single squares in patches of size 1 (lone squares) does nothing

**Features planned**:
- press space key to bring up 'give up' option, when no more patches can be vanished
- add sound and background music
- add animation to squares that change colour
- add more colour themes, that players can choose to play with
